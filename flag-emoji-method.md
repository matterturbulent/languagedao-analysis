## Flag Emoji Method

### Collection 
The server makes a post in its onboarding section, asking individuals to 
respond with an emoji corresponding to the language they speak (such as 
nationality flag). 

Servers can require a reponse in order for members to get access to the broader server, 
increasing the probability memmbers respond with an emoji.  

### Analysis 
By hand, calcuate the proportion of speakers that speak each language, relative
to the total number of emoji respondentsÂ 

Automation would make the process easier, but Discord forbids scraping
