Method used in Excel for cleaning the data derived from the Google Form

The example dataset was produced from an OAT campaign LanguageDAO ran 


1) Sorted Language column alphabetically

2) Ran de-duplication method on Excel, de-duplifying by Discord handle

3) Used find and replace method to swap all instances of “‰∏≠Êñá” with Chinese
3a) SOURCE: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mssql/issues/1059

4) Deleted other instances of other encoding issues 28. Possibility of introducing 
systematic bias, if all the characters represent a particular language and these 
entries were removed. In this case, 30 is minor relative to an N over 2000

5) Used find and replace method to swap all instances of “Mandarin” with “Chinese”

6) By hand, deleted all rows with no answer for Language column, answers “NA” various 
versions of “LanguageDAO,” incorrect inputs of Discord name or otherwise, Twitter links, etc

7) By hand, made commas the separator between languages, versus alternatives like the & symbol. 

8) By hand, deleted fringe entries which couldn’t be identified as other languages. Represented 
a small amount. 

9) By hand, standardized entries, such as changing “britain” to “english” or “Bahasa Indonesia” 
to “indonesian”

10) By hand, deleted entries that reported “Koe” as their language because after checking 
approximately a third on Twitter the accounts appeared to all be different bots
