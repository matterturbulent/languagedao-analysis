Galaxy Campaign Language Analysis Methodology

Data Cleaning

Excel
Sorted Language column alphabetically
Ran de-duplication method on Excel, de-duplifying by Discord handle
Used find and replace method to swap all instances of “‰∏≠Êñá” with Chinese
SOURCE: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mssql/issues/1059
Deleted other instances of other encoding issues 28. Possibility of introducing systematic bias, if all the characters represent a particular language and these entries were removed. In this case, 30 is minor relative to an N over 2000
Used find and replace method to swap all instances of “Mandarin” with “Chinese”
By hand, deleted all rows with no answer for Language column, answers “NA” various versions of “LanguageDAO,” incorrect inputs of Discord name or otherwise, Twitter links, etc
By hand, made commas the separator between languages, versus alternatives like the & symbol. 
By hand, deleted fringe entries which couldn’t be identified as other languages. Represented a small amount, 
By hand, standardized entries, such as changing “britain” to “english” or “Bahasa Indonesia” to “indonesian”
By hand, deleted 23 entries that reported “Koe” as their language because after checking approximately a third on Twitter the accounts appeared to all be different bots 

Final N = 2179 after Excel cleaning 



Other Notes:
In future Galaxy forms we should ask submitters to provide email address, so we can build out a massive dataset of people in web3, their contact info, what language they speak, etc. The dataset is valuable, and on a form-by-form basis, collecting emails might represent a value proposition for clients. 
Need to find a more automated way of cleaning fringe cases, versus cleaning by hand
